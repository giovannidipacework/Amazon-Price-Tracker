# Amazon Price Tracker
This project is developed as part of an advanced programming course and provides a desktop application for tracking prices of products on Amazon. The application features a user-friendly JavaFX interface that allows users to add products either by manually searching for them or by entering their ASIN codes. It connects to Amazon’s API to fetch up-to-date product information and price data. All data is stored securely on a SQL server to enable persistent tracking and historical price analysis.
